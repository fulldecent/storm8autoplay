# Summary

Autoplay automates the leveling-up gameplay steps of Storm8 games. Fully automated play works for most games.

Cheating is not directly supported for Mobsters, Rockstar, Zombies Live, Ninjas Live, Vampires Live, World War, and whatever other new ones they come out with, but Autoplay does MOST of the work for you. While running this script I did get to first place on everything except Ninjas and World War (username fulldecent).

# Functionality

* Automatically find and trade codes to join armies
* Perform financial analysis of real estate options and purchase options to maximize compound return on investment
* Run missions
* Attack other players

# Getting started / usage

First, find your own player ID by playing the game while connected to WireShark or Charles.app.

Edit the scripts (`*.bash`) to use your own player ID (cookie).

On Mac or Linux, run each of these scripts in your cron job or from the command line.

# Contributing

PROJECT SCOPE: To keep scripts working and implement simple autoplay function.

MY MOTIVATION: I made this to cheat/autoplay the game and learn more about automation.

Contributions to this project are welcome. You will need to take moderate effort to
get it working if there have been major changes to the games since I last updated.
I am not interested to support this project. But if you are interested to take the
lead in making it work then I'll be happy to review and merge in the changes here.
